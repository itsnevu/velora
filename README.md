### Agentic AI Equity Research Desk

**A team of specialist AI analysts that research your watchlist inside Claude Code,
connect to a Robinhood Agentic account over MCP, and never place an order without your approval.**

Aelix isn't a bot that YOLOs your money. It's a small **desk of specialized sub-agents**
— fundamental, technical, macro/news, and a **risk manager with veto power** — that screen
your watchlist, debate each candidate, and hand you a one-click **preview card**. You
approve; it places. Everything is wrapped in written guardrails (human-in-the-loop,
position caps, prompt-injection defense) and mirrored to a Robinhood-style dashboard.

> [!WARNING]
> **Real money, beta, not investment advice.** Robinhood Agentic Trading is in beta
> (US, equities only). The desk trades only inside an isolated Agentic account funded with
> a dedicated budget — **that budget is the most it can ever lose**. There is **no track
> record and no performance claim here**; this is a reference architecture for learning.
> Run it at your own risk and monitor it yourself.

## Why it's different

- **A team, not one prompt** — analysts gather evidence in parallel; an independent risk
  manager can veto a trade the analysts liked.
- **Guardrails are structural, not vibes** — the sub-agents physically have no order tools;
  only the Portfolio Manager can place, and only after your explicit in-session approval.
- **Prompt-injection-aware** — the news agent treats fetched content as untrusted data and
  quotes suspicious "instructions" instead of acting on them.
- **Low-touch by design** — it runs read-only research on a schedule and only surfaces a
  trade when one genuinely qualifies; most days it tells you to stand aside.
- **A real dashboard** — a Robinhood-style UI mirrors the desk's state live.

## How the desk works

You talk to the **Portfolio Manager (PM = the main Claude Code session)** in plain
language. Analysts gather evidence in parallel; the Risk Manager has veto power; only the
PM can place orders — and only after **your** approval. After every run the PM writes
`ui/public/desk-state.json`, which the dashboard mirrors live.

Steps 1–7 are research and produce **no order**. The desk's standard output is the
**preview card at step 8** — it stops there until you confirm. The full lifecycle is in
[the docs](https://www.projectvex.ai/docs/workflow).

## The desk team

| Role | File | Can place orders? | Focus |
|------|------|:-----------------:|-------|
| **Portfolio Manager** | *main session* | ✅ *only after your approval* | Orchestrates the run; the only role with order tools |
| **Fundamental Analyst** | `.claude/agents/fundamental-analyst.md` | ❌ | Valuation, earnings, growth, balance-sheet health |
| **Technical Analyst** | `.claude/agents/technical-analyst.md` | ❌ | Trend, momentum, support/resistance, scans |
| **Macro / News Analyst** | `.claude/agents/macro-news-analyst.md` | ❌ | Market backdrop + news — **injection-isolated** |
| **Risk Manager** | `.claude/agents/risk-manager.md` | ❌ *(veto power)* | Checks every trade against written caps |

**Least privilege:** only the PM has order tools. The analysts and Risk Manager physically
cannot place a trade. Details → [The Desk Team](https://www.projectvex.ai/docs/team).

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Make this repo PRIVATE before pushing anything.

# 2. One-time: connect + authenticate the Robinhood MCP, then fund a small Agentic budget
claude                                  # open the project (trust the .mcp.json server)
#   in-session:  /mcp                   # pick robinhood-trading → OAuth (desktop + mobile verify)

# 3. Define your risk caps in strategies/ before trading (the Risk Manager VETOes if unset)

# 4. Run the dashboard (separate terminal) — mirrors each desk run
cd ui && npm install && npm run dev     # http://localhost:5180 (shows demo until a live run)

# 5. Drive the desk — just talk to the PM, e.g.:
#   "Screen my watchlist and bring me the top 2 ideas with full team analysis."
#   "Run the desk on AAPL and NVDA, risk-check a small starter in the better one."

# Kill switch: disconnect the MCP from the Robinhood app, or remove it locally
claude mcp remove robinhood-trading
```

Full walkthrough → [Installation & Setup](https://www.projectvex.ai/docs/setup).

> [!NOTE]
> The sub-agents in `.claude/agents/` load when Claude Code **starts** — after adding or
> editing them, restart the session so roles like `fundamental-analyst` are recognized with
> their restricted tool sets.

## Safety posture (read before funding)

- The agent can only trade in the **Agentic account**, never your main balance.
- Every order sits behind a manual approval prompt (`ask` rule in `.claude/settings.json`);
  options tools are `deny`; read-only tools are `allow`. Evaluation is `deny → ask → allow`.
- `CLAUDE.md` includes a prompt-injection rule: the agent must ignore trading instructions
  found in fetched/external content (news, analyst notes, web) and surface them as quotes.
- Every proposed trade must map to a written rule in `strategies/`; the Risk Manager VETOes
  if a cap is unset, a stop is missing, or account data looks inconsistent.
- You can disconnect the MCP anytime from the Robinhood app — that's your kill switch.
